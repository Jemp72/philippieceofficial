        <br>
        <br>
        The Philippine-American War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902, emerged as a bitter conflict following the Treaty of Paris in 1898, which ended the Spanish-American War and transferred control of the Philippines from Spain to the United States. Despite initial hopes for independence, Filipino nationalists, who had been fighting against Spanish rule, found themselves facing a new colonial power. Led by figures like Emilio Aguinaldo, the Filipinos declared independence from both Spain and the United States, sparking a protracted struggle against American military forces.

        The war was characterized by intense guerrilla warfare and atrocities committed by both sides. American forces, equipped with superior firepower and tactics, engaged in a brutal campaign to suppress Filipino resistance, which included the destruction of villages, torture, and the imposition of "scorched earth" policies. The Filipino insurgents, though outnumbered and outgunned, mounted a determined defense of their homeland, utilizing hit-and-run tactics and drawing on widespread support from the local population.

        The Philippine-American War ultimately ended in an American victory, with Emilio Aguinaldo's capture in 1901 marking a significant turning point. Despite the formal cessation of hostilities in 1902, sporadic resistance continued for several years. The war resulted in significant loss of life on both sides, with estimates of Filipino casualties ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. The conflict also had long-lasting consequences for Philippine society, politics, and culture, shaping the country's relationship with the United States and influencing its path towards eventual independence in 1946.
