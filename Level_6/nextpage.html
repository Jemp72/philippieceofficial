        <br>
        <br>
        Following the conclusion of the Philippine-American War in 1902, the Philippines became an American colony, with the United States implementing various reforms aimed at modernizing the country's infrastructure, education system, and government institutions. However, calls for independence persisted, with Filipino nationalists continuing to push for self-rule and sovereignty.

        <br>
        Throughout the early 20th century, Filipino leaders such as Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osme√±a worked towards achieving greater autonomy for the Philippines within the American colonial framework. This culminated in the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Act in 1934, which provided for the establishment of a transitional period leading to full independence for the Philippines. Subsequently, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was inaugurated in 1935, with Manuel Quezon serving as its first president.

        The road to independence faced challenges, including the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines from 1942 to 1945. However, Filipino resistance persisted, and with the assistance of Allied forces, the Philippines was liberated from Japanese control in 1945. On July 4, 1946, the United States formally recognized Philippine independence, and the country transitioned to a sovereign republic with Manuel Roxas as its first president. The journey towards independence was a testament to the resilience and determination of the Filipino people in their pursuit of self-determination and national sovereignty.
